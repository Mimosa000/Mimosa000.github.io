Hello, my name is Zijun Zhou. Welcome to my personal page!

I am a highly motivated **Data Analyst** and **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Analyst** with a passion for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in analyzing large datasets and geospatial information to support critical decision-making processes.

As a data analyst, I have successfully designed and implemented data-driven solutions for various real-life problems. My expertise lies in `data visualization`, `statistical analysis`, and `predictive modeling`, and I have a proven track record of translating data into actionable recommendations.

In the realm of GIS analysis, I have utilized my spatial analysis skills to solve real-world problems, such as _optimizing transportation routes_, _conducting health inequity assessments_, and _identifying potential areas for testing novel rodent control methods_. Utilizing tools such as ArcGIS Pro, I create accurate and visually compelling maps that effectively communicate insights.

My journey into the world of data and GIS began with a fascination for how these technologies can bring data to life and influence strategic decision-making. I am continually motivated to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in data analysis and geospatial technology.

I am proud to hold a Master's degree in **Applied Urban Science and Informatics** from **New York University Center for Urban Science + Progress (NYU CUSP)**. Additionally, my strong foundation in **Statistics**, achieved through a Bachelor's degree from **Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)**, has provided me with a solid analytical background.

As a lifelong learner, I am excited to explore new challenges and contribute my expertise to organizations that value data-driven insights and innovation. My goal is to collaborate with like-minded professionals to make a meaningful impact in the realm of data analysis and GIS.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you to discuss potential opportunities!
